  <p>
    I am a witty kind of a guy, who loves to be happy and make others happy. But I am damn serious when it comes to Coding.
    I belong to a very small city, probably you have never heard of it. It is near to Pushkar and on the outskirts of Ajmer, Kishangarh.
    I am doing an undergraduate course on Computer Science Engineering at Indian Institute Of Information Technology, Vadodara. I am in
    my 3rd year of this course. I have keen intrest in Machine Learning, Competitve Programming, Python Development.
