## Friends for Life
The plot is already set. Now we have passed class 10<sup>th</sup> and now we all had to separate into
different streams. We thought that we are going to go in different classes, but it happens to be more
than that. Friends gone to different schools, some gone to different cities, and in the midst of it
standing me, who tries to get along with all of them. As I am an engineer so i had obviously selected
Science Math and as all engineering aspirants, I was also preparing for JEE (Joint Entrance Examination).
In that class I have a small bag of old friends (*Aditya, Shantanu, Shivam*) and also introduced to some
new one's, you can say that they all of them are not completly new, because i haven't talked to them before
(*Sejal, Saloni*).There were some new faces whom i have encountered in my tution classes in 10<sup>th</sup> 
(*Abhijeet, Devansh, Ramprasad, Harsh a.k.a Gohda*).

That was a very crucial point in my life as i was preparing to pursue my future and have to study very hard to
climb the huge wall of JEE. In all the tension and loads of work there were friends like *Aditya & Shantanu* who always try
to tickle our laughing bone. I remembered that *Abhijeet, Devansh, Ramprasad and Harsh* used to sit at back and
we all know what recipes had cooked in those talks. No need to pin point it. I am largely influenced by *Abhijeet*
in my study and as well as what i am now. He taught me to learn for self and not for others. He is still my 
prime competitor on codechef. I am having a high rank in Long challenges and he has in lunch time. So he used to 
call me to improve my lunch time rankings and saying only one thing to counter his long challenge ratings that *"Lunch time
is of shorter span and needs more skill them long challenge."* But neverthless i still have higher rank on Spoj.
And also i need to pin point one person too that is *Aditya* , see in those serious times, he is so cheerfull that in
saddest of all moments, he still tries to make others happy and that thing i learned from him. He always says whenever
we go out *Bro Petrol khatam ho gya Bharwa de*. I now had climbed the wall of JEE and successfully entered into IIITV.

Now my college life starts, as this is the most intresting part of my life which i am still living. My first year 
room mates were *Person from Bihar, Person from UP, Person from Vizag*. A Deadly pack. Our room is always filled
with atleast two or more south indians *Pawan Kumar, Deepak, Manikanta*. And my friend's from UP are individuals
gems from all corners of UP: *Maneesh* (*Hum Kh rhe hai naa guy*), *Aditya* (*Itna pelege tumhe, Sab napege guy*),
*Prakhar|ITS* (*Taylor swift fan, dancer baa*), *Adwait* (*Aeeee Laadddhhaaa guy*). Not to forget the brother of UP,
Bihari Tiger. They all say only one thing everyday in conversation with all the North guys *Ek Bihari sab pae bhari*. 
*Niranjan* (*Sab kam Bachpan se kiye hai*), *Shahrukh* (*Bakra*). Them comes our own home land pack the Rajwadi's.
Its a small pack and only contains one individual *Chetanya* (*Mujhe to nhi lagta isse kuch aata hai*). There is
one from MP and part of its is UP *Ashu* (*Beckham Boy Miya*). But yaa they are the ones whom i spent thrilling two years 
of my college life and going to spent two more. But i have learn't one time from living them is there is a very thin
line between *Gym* and *Geam* . Hope you catched Bro. And yaa that's all they are pack who are with me everytime i 
need them. 

Hope you liked it. On this note wait **Be Happy and make others happy** wait for my next post. If in any case i missed
some name's, sorry for that. Do not take this as you are not my friends. You all are. **Thank You** for being with me.
