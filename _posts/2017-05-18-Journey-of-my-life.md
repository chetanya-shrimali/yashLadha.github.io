## Friends For Life
It's been a long time, when i wrote something creative else than the creepy lines of code. I am in my third
year of college life, and from now onwards we all start to worry about our future. But the memories of past and the time spent 
with others till now still drives me in the hardest of all situations and i went pass through them. Time spent with 
Friends and Friends themselves are powerful themselves that can upbring any mind from the shade of sadness. And this is
my take to thank all my friends who are there with me in this journey. I may skip one or two name sorry for that, But will
try to cover all. So Let's get started.

Journey of my life starts on **29 June** (year can't be disclosed, else you will try to judge me on my age).
When we were young we are free from any worries. That was the happiest time of everyone's life. At that time i made some
friends which are also along with me till now. Shivam, Rohit, Mohit, it feels very good, when on a random day i received a 
message from one of my old buddies that *Kya saale, bhut time ho gya? Ek message bhi nhi kr skta tha kya?* . But still being 
with me is one of the precious gems that is embedded into my life. Sometimes i doubt about your intelligence, that you have 
a brain or not? but one will always say that *I also doubt the same* .

Then I changed my school because we had shifted to a new place. Whenever we go to a new school or our school has changed or
we transfered to a new section. we always first tries to search for a buddy, who introduces us to the rest of them. And also 
most of my class mates also live nearby my house. So there is no problem in making friends, but the thing that they taught me
is still i adore, which is sense of competition. I remember that there were two brother named Sandeep and Kamal, who are 
super smart and i was a very dumb student. But at that time i realised the feeling of staying behind others. But as the time
passed i started growing and as the seed sprouts and going to become a tree it may shreds some leafs at early stages but in the 
end it will rise up to a full blown tree which gives shadow to others. And them come the hard moment i again have to change schools.

It is becoming so difficult for me to constantly change the mode of my life. Anyways this is the most intresting part in my 
life. Here i made friends that taught me great lessons and taught me how to be happy and make others happy. I am now in 9<sup>th</sup>
standard. Hmm... one of the most intresting class i must say. I again met to one of my childhood best-friend *Rohit* on the first
day of school. That environment has some charm in it. And later on i meet to my second childhood best friend *Shivam* .
But i was informed that my sections had changed and i need to go to other section. When i entered into the new classroom, there 
were all new faces staring at me. I am searching for acquaintances but not founded a single. When half day past i started becoming
comfortable with other class mates. They all introduced themselves to me. My first few friends from that class was *Arihant, Aditya, Rakshit,*
*Manan, Ayush, Shubham, Shantanu, Bafu* . And in the first time in my life, I had joined tution classes. We enjoyed more at *G.C.*(My tution class name), than
at school. I made one friend there who is still one of my partners in crime *Sparsh*. He is a guy whom is there for me every time i
have asked to him. And in all the fun of going to school and having fun at coaching. we forgot that we are now in 10<sup>th</sup> standard.
And this phase truly changed the plot. This time i am having that same old and best pack from previous (*Rakshit, Manan, Shantanu a.k.a Bobby*)year but all shuffled up. I met
some new faces (*Sidhi, Amisha, Shakshi, Muskan*). Those faces turned to become friends in no time, and not only friends, they became an intrinsic part of my life. 

I always remember that when i came from school, i stay at my house for only an hour and used to go to place of my friends. We played
there, we studied there, we laughed there, we made memories there. And i still remember i almost everyday (exaggeration) goes to 
one of my friend's house to see and just talk to her. When i talk to her, it is the best feeling that i can experience and sitting behind
me was the partner in my crime's. I shared almost everyhting to them and they were more like anything to me till now. There may be less
conversation between us but still you all will remain friends for my whole life.

And as i see this post is stretching too long, my take on friends at my college will be in my next post...
